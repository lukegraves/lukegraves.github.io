“Luke Graves is without question the best agent I have ever  worked with.  I was an out of town buyer with a limited schedule and  Luke always accommodated my needs and worked with me in a manner most  efficient for my time constraints.  He is professional, honest, knows  his business (above everything else) and easy to work with.  It took me  about a year to find what I wanted but Luke was always there with an  encouraging word to help me press on until I found the perfect property  for me. I would highly recommend him.”

“Relocating from Chicago to Austin was very stressful on every  level.  We didn’t know much about the real estate market, and were  getting nowhere fast working on our own.  When we began working with  Luke, he did a great job of showing us what we could afford in several  different parts of town.  As a long time resident he really knew the  turf and was able to help us with pros and cons of each area.  I can  honestly say that he went above and beyond our expectations by showing  us more property that we really thought we needed to see.  He was  insistent on showing us everything, so that we could make the best  decision.  After a few days of seeing houses we had a great feel for the  market and the City of Austin.  I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Luke  Graves to anybody, and I have on several occasions.  Having never had a  great experience with a real estate professional, working with Luke was  better than I ever expected was possible.”

“Luke did a great job helping us find and close on the perfect  home for us.  We had to have things done very quickly and Luke was able  to help us meet our tight deadlines without a problem.  And everything  was done thoroughly and professionally.”

“Our search for a home was made much easier with the help of Luke  Graves, our Realtor. Luke was thorough, prompt and persistent. He  listened to us from the very beginning to understand what we were  looking for in a new home. Armed with that knowledge, Luke was able to  filter out the homes and areas that wouldn’t meet our criteria,  ultimately saving us time and headache. Luke is also very knowledgeable  about the areas of Austin and kept us up to date on the schools, crime,  development, etc. He diligently took us out every Saturday looking for  homes and never once showed any frustration and impatience on his part.  He was always confident we would find a home. Even when our own  frustrations took a toll, Luke was always positive and encouraging. When  we found our home, Luke’s expertise played a key role getting us our  contract. Luke was able to get us a better than expected price, well  under the asking price, for our home. Always the professional, he  treated both sides of the parties with respect and courtesy that made  the whole process very smooth and easygoing. We love our home and thank  Luke for making it all possible.”

“Being 1st time home buyers we were extremely nervous to just  start the process of buying a home. A friend gave us Luke’s name and  encouraged us to call him. Once we contacted Luke everything fell into  place. We weren’t sure what we wanted but we knew what we didn’t want.  Luke took our ideas and worked week after week helping us to find the  home we had imagined. Luke made us both comfortable with questions and  was such a professional through the entire process. He kept us informed  daily as we moved into a contract. His guidance made buying a home easy.  Our family and friends wanted to know who we were working with because  Luke had us so well organized. We cannot imagine that anyone could do a  better job than he did. We will recommend him to anyone we know and will  certainly work with him again in the future.”

“From day one, Luke was in our corner. He went above and beyond  to find a house that was not only within our price range, but was  everything we could have wanted. He has a passionate commitment to his  work, and will put in 110% to find you the home you’re looking for.”

“Luke Graves is a consummate professional that worked tirelessly  to defend our interests at all times—this extended far beyond  representing us on the buy-side of our deal, which was what we  contracted him to do.  In fact, we had some complicating circumstances  on both the sell and buy sides of our deal which we would not have been  able to overcome if it had not been for Luke.  He became the true  liaison between the realtor selling our previous home, the realtor and  lender representing the buyer of our previous home (resident, non-US  citizens), and the realtor and relocation company representing the  seller of current home.  Without going into grueling detail, Luke was  the glue that kept all parties focused and in lockstep ensuring the sale  of our previous home and the purchase of our new home!  Besides  traversing a complex deal, Luke walked us through an exhaustive search  and tour of Austin homes to ensure we were making the right decision  that exceeded our long list of wants, needs, and expectations.  In  addition to generously giving his time, his knowledge, and himself  throughout the entire process, it is important to point out that Luke  knows his business and the Greater Austin area inside and out.  Luke’s  well planted roots in the Austin area provide a very strong network of  real estate professionals (realtors, mortgage lenders, home inspectors,  attorneys, insurance companies, home repair specialists, etc.) that are  all willing to bend over backwards for him and those he represents.  Not  only would we employ Luke’s services in the future, but also have  recommended him to friends and family whom have all been equally  impressed.”
